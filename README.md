# Client Term Deposit Subscription Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the analysis of client subscription behavior for term deposits. Using a dataset with demographic, financial, and campaign-related features, we aim to uncover insights that can optimize marketing strategies and enhance client engagement. This documentation includes **Milestone 1** (EDA and preprocessing) and **Milestone 2** (feature transformation and model training).

## **Milestones**

### **Milestone 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing**

#### **1. Data Understanding**
The dataset contains information about clients, including their demographics, past interactions, financial status, and marketing outcomes. The target variable (`y`) indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit.

#### **2. Data Preprocessing**
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - `contact` and `poutcome`: Missing values replaced with `"unknown"`.
   - `pdays`: Missing values imputed with `-1` to signify no previous contact.

2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
   - **One-hot encoding** applied to `job`, `education`, `contact`, and `poutcome`.
   - **Binary encoding** used for `housing` and `loan`.

3. **Scaling Numerical Features**:
   - Standardized features such as `age`, `balance`, `campaign`, and `pdays`.

---

#### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. **Key Insights**:
   - Higher subscription rates observed in students, retirees, and university-educated individuals.
   - Cellular contact methods are most effective.
   - Previous campaign success strongly predicts future subscription likelihood.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Revealed strong correlations between certain features (`previous`, `poutcome_success`).

### **Milestone 2: Feature Transformation and Model Training**

#### **1. Feature Transformation**
1. **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Encoding**: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.

#### **2. Data Splitting**
- Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

#### **3. Model Training**
Three machine learning models were trained:
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Baseline model to provide interpretable results.
2. **Random Forest**:
   - Ensemble model for robust performance and reduced overfitting.
3. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**:
   - High-accuracy model suitable for structured datasets.

#### **4. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)**
- Performed grid search to optimize model parameters:
   - Random Forest: Tuned `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`.
   - XGBoost: Tuned `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`.

## **Results and Outputs**
1. **Preprocessed Dataset**: Complete feature set ready for modeling.
2. **Trained Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
3. **Best Hyperparameters** (optional):
   - **Random Forest**: Optimal number of trees and depth.
   - **XGBoost**: Ideal learning rate, depth, and number of estimators.

## **Next Steps**
The next milestone focuses on **model evaluation**, where we will assess the modelsâ€™ performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model will then be used for predictions.
