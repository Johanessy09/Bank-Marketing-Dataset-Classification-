# Client Term Deposit Subscription Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the analysis of client subscription behavior for term deposits. Using a dataset with demographic, financial, and campaign-related features, we aim to uncover insights that can optimize marketing strategies and enhance client engagement. This documentation includes **Milestone 1**, which covers extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing of the data.

## **Milestone 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing**

### **1. Data Understanding**
#### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains information about clients, including their demographics, past interactions, financial status, and marketing outcomes. The target variable (`y`) indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
#### **Handling Missing Values**
- **`contact` and `poutcome`:** Missing values were replaced with `"unknown"`.
- **`pdays`:** Missing values were imputed with `-1` to signify no previous contact.

#### **Encoding Categorical Variables**
- **One-hot encoding:** Applied to categorical variables such as `job`, `education`, `contact`, and `poutcome`, converting each category into a binary column.
- **Binary encoding:** Used for `housing` and `loan` features.

#### **Scaling Numerical Features**
- Numerical features like `age`, `balance`, `campaign`, and `pdays` were standardized for consistent scaling, ensuring compatibility with machine learning models.

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### **Summary Statistics**
Key metrics for numerical features were analyzed:
- Mean `age`: ~40 years
- Median yearly balance: ~â‚¬400
- High variability observed in `campaign` and `duration`.

#### **Visualizations and Key Insights**
1. **Job**:
   - **Subscription rates:**
     - Higher: `Student` (28%), `Retired` (25%)
     - Lower: `Blue-collar` (7%), `Unemployed` (8%)
   - **Insight:** Students and retired clients are highly likely to subscribe, while blue-collar workers and unemployed individuals require targeted strategies.

2. **Marital Status**:
   - **Subscription rates:**
     - Single: 14.4%
     - Divorced: 11.4%
     - Married: 9.6%
   - **Insight:** Singles show the highest likelihood of subscribing, whereas married clients have the lowest.

3. **Education Level**:
   - **Subscription rates:**
     - Higher: University degree (20%), Professional courses (17%)
     - Lower: Basic education levels (e.g., basic.4y: 4.5%)
   - **Insight:** Higher education levels correlate with higher subscription rates.

4. **Contact Type**:
   - **Subscription rates:**
     - Cellular: 13.7%
     - Telephone: 4.5%
     - Unknown: 2.5%
   - **Insight:** Cellular is the most effective contact method.

5. **Poutcome**:
   - **Subscription rates:**
     - Success: 65.3%
     - Failure: 13.8%
     - Nonexistent: 9.5%
   - **Insight:** Successful outcomes from previous campaigns strongly indicate future subscription likelihood.

#### **Correlation Analysis**
A correlation heatmap revealed:
- Strong positive correlation between `previous` and `poutcome_success`.
- Weak correlation between demographic features like `age` and the target variable (`y`).

### **4. Feature Importance**
Based on EDA, the following features are identified as significant for predictive modeling:
- **Highly Relevant:**
  - `job`
  - `education`
  - `contact`
  - `poutcome`
  - `balance`
- **Excluded:**
  - `duration` (not used for realistic predictions, per guidelines)

---

### **5. Recommendations**
1. **Marketing Strategies:**
   - Focus campaigns on high-performing groups like students, retirees, and university-educated individuals.
   - Leverage cellular contact methods for engagement.

2. **Next Steps:**
   - Perform cross-variable analysis (e.g., job and education level).
   - Build predictive models using identified features.

## **Future Milestones**
### **Milestone 2: Modeling**
Develop machine learning models for predicting term deposit subscription (`y`), leveraging insights from Milestone 1.
